Project Title: Economic Index Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

Overview
This project aims to predict the economic index based on multiple economic indicators using multiple linear regression in machine learning. The economic index is a composite index that reflects the overall economic health of a country. By predicting this index, we can gain insights into the economic trends and make informed decisions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data for various economic indicators such as interest rate, unemployment rate, index price etc., along with the corresponding economic index values.

Methodology
used multiple linear regression to predict the economic index based on the economic indicators. Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.
